# üßæ Image-to-Google-Sheet Workflow

This project is a full-stack, Dockerized workflow that extracts structured tables from images using OCR, parses them with AI, and automatically logs the results into a Google Sheet. Built for rapid, reliable automation of data entry from images‚Äîsuch as financial documents, invoices, or tables.

---

## üì¶ Overview

The system combines the following components:

- **Frontend** (`frontend/page.tsx`):  
  Upload images and trigger the workflow via a web UI.
- **OCR API** (`ocr-api/main.py`):  
  FastAPI service that uses PaddleOCR to extract tables from images.
- **n8n Automation** (`workflow.json`):  
  Orchestrates the workflow: receives webhooks, calls OCR, runs an AI agent for table parsing, and writes results to Google Sheets.
- **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`):  
  Orchestrates all services (frontend, OCR API, n8n, Postgres, etc).

## üöÄ Getting Started


### 1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anoopkarnik/image-to-ocr-app.git
cd image-to-ocr-app
```

### 2. **Build and run all the containers**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. **Fill the credentials in n8n**

1. Open the n8n locally: http://localhost:5101
2. Register the n8n local account.
3. Open the Paddle Ocr Workflow.
4. In the app, fill OpenAI credentials and Google sheet credentials(make sure the google sheet selected has correct column names).(For more details on how to get Google sheet client id and secret, check the end)
5. Change the workflow from Inactive to Active

### 4. **Image To Google Sheet**

1. Open the nextjs app locally: http://localhost:5103
2. The default n8n webhook will be in input.(no need to change that)
3. Select the currency.
4. Upload, drag and drop or paste the image.
5. Click on Convert, to update your google sheet with table values.

The image is sent to n8n workflow which has the OCR API, which extracts table data. n8n workflow parses and structures the data with AI, then writes it to your configured Google Sheet.

## üìã Example Workflow

1. User uploads image 
2. Frontend POSTs to n8n webhook 
3. n8n calls OCR API ‚Üí
4. AI agent parses extracted text into structured JSON ‚Üí
5. Structured rows are appended to Google Sheet

## üöÄ Setting Up Google OAuth Client for Google Sheets

This guide walks you through creating a Google OAuth client for accessing Google Sheets, and getting your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

---

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console

[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

---

###  2. Create or Select a Project

- Click the project dropdown (top left).
- Select your project, or click **‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù** to create one.

---

###  3. Enable Google Sheets and Drive APIs

- Go to **APIs & Services ‚Üí Library** in the left sidebar.
- Search for **‚ÄúGoogle Sheets API‚Äù** and click **Enable**.
- Do the same for **‚ÄúGoogle Drive API‚Äù**.

---

###  4. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

- Go to **APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen**.
- Choose **‚ÄúExternal‚Äù** for public apps, **‚ÄúInternal‚Äù** for GSuite org only.
- Fill in:
  - **App name**
  - **User support email**
  - **Developer contact email**
- Save and continue (add scopes and test users as needed).

---

### # 5. Create OAuth Client ID

- Go to **APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**.
- Click **‚Äú+ Create Credentials‚Äù ‚Üí OAuth client ID**.
- Choose **Application type**:
  - **Web application**: for web servers
- Name your client (e.g., `My Sheets App`).
- **Authorized redirect URIs**:
  - For web: `http://localhost:5101/rest/oauth2-credential/callback` (app‚Äôs callback URL)
- Click **Create**.

---

## 6. Get Client ID and Secret

- After creating, a dialog shows your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- Download the credentials JSON, or copy the values to your app/config.

---

## 7. Use in Your App

- Plug these credentials into your app‚Äôs OAuth setup to authenticate users and access their Google Sheets.
- Implement OAuth flow with the help of libraries (e.g., `google-auth-library`, `googleapis`, etc).
